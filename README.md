# New Logic Task

This is a test task I was given for the frontend position at New Logic.

This website is written with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org), using [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) as a CSS framework and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) as an animation framework. For icons, I used [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).

## Getting Started

Get all the packages by running:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

You can either run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

or build it into a production version:

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
# or
yarn build && yarn start
```

Both will start the server on a port 3000 by default. You can override that with a flag `-p <PORT>`.
